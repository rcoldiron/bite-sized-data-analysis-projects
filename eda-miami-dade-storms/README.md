# Exploratory Data Analysis: Miami-Dade County StormWind Events

For this project, I downloaded a dataset from the National Centers for Environmental Information to analyze thunderstorm winds and tornadoes in Miami-Dade County in Florida from 2010-2020. You can search the Storm Events Database to select the events that you want to research within a specific timeframe and area.
