# Exploratory Data Analysis: Miami-Dade County StormWind Events

For this project, I downloaded a dataset from the National Centers for Environmental Information to analyze thunderstorm winds and tornadoes in Miami-Dade County in Florida from 2010-2020. The Storm Event Database allows users to search for storm events and download a focused dataset.

## Analysis Process

- Created a Python virtual environment
- Installed the following packages: `notebook`, `ipywidgets`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `statistics`, `matplotlib`, and `rich-dataframe`.
- Recorded the commands I used in a Python file
- Ran the analysis in a Jupyter Notebook, specifically to get the visualizations

## Summary of Findings
